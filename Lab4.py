This program gives the user three tries to answer the quesiton 
question = "what is the capital of California". With the answer being Sacramento
We have to set a value for the three tries they get: max_tries = 3.
Then we create a loop to iterate three times. For each iteration, we ask the user for the answer. 
Then based on the answer the user gives, we check to see if the user input matches the correct answer. 
If so we print "correct!" then terminate the loop.

If the user fails to guess the correct answer within three tries, then print
"You have used up all your guesses"
